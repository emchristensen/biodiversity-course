Tuesdays are often a split between class activity and discussion, thus there are often two topics on those days. Thursdays are always just discussion. Activity days when laptops are required are noted in italics.

               * How does Hubbell's view of communities compare to the Biotic/Environmental filter papers?
                  * Is there an important concept deliberately ignores?
