Tuesdays are often a split between class activity and discussion, thus there are often two topics on those days. Thursdays are always just discussion. Activity days when laptops are required are noted in italics.

### Weeks 1 & 2: Thinking about what biodiversity means/is

* August 23: Introductions. What does the word biodiversity mean to you?

* August 25: Why are we interested in biodiversity?
    * Reading: [Accelerated modern human-induced species losses: Entering the 6th mass extinction](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1400253 )


* *August 30:* 
    * Discussion: What is biodiversity? Pt 1 (Concept/Construct, Alpha-Beta-Gamma) 
        * Reading: What is Biodiversity? by Kevin Gaston (sent via course listserv)
        * Reading: [Inventory, differentiations, and proportional diversity for quantifying species diversity](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1190-z)
    * Class Activity: Exploring Diversity Indices
        * Reading (not required): [A consistent terminology for quantifying species diversity? Yes, it does exist](https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs00442-010-1812-0)

* September 1 - CANCELLED - PREPARE FOR HERMINE.  September 1: Dimensions of Biodiversity - Phylogenetic, Taxonomic, Functional

* *September 6:* 
    * Discussion: Dimensions of Biodiversity - Phylogenetic, Taxonomic, Functional
         * Reading: [Vive le difference: plant functional diversity matters to ecosystem function](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02283-2)
         * Reading: [Preserving the Tree of Life](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1085510)
    * Class Activity: Exploring Diversity Indices continued - BRING LAPTOP/SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR/PHONE 
      WITH SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR (i.e. something to do math with exponents and square roots on)

### Weeks 3-6: Local-scale Biodiversity Patterns & Processes

* September 8: Assembly Mechanisms - Biotic and Environmental Filters
      * Reading: [Rebuilding community ecology from functional traits](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2006.02.002)
      * Reading: [Community assembly, coexistence and the environmental filtering metaphor](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12345)
 
* September 13: 
    * Discussion: Assembly Mechanisms - Niches/Deterministic vs. Neutral/Stochastic
         * Reading: [Disentangling the importance of ecological niches from stochastic processes across scales](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0063)
            * Note from Morgan: Don't get hung up on the MacArthur's paradox section. There are a lot of quick references to different community ecology models in that section, but this is not the key part of the paper I want you to think about. Focus your attention on the section "towards a more comprehensive framework for niche-based community ecology"
         * Reading: [Neutral theory and the evolution of ecological equivalence](https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1387:NTATEO]2.0.CO;2)
            * Note from Morgan: I will provide a cartoon overview of the Neutral Theory in class. In this reading, I want you to focus on the following issues:
               * How does Hubbell's view of communities compare to the Biotic/Environmental filter papers?
                  * Is there an important concept he renounces?
               * Does Hubbell think stable coexistence is necessary for communities?
               * What are some of the ways species equivalence might occur in nature?
      * Class Activity: Structuring Introductions of Papers/Proposals and what that has to do with your Class Project
