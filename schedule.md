         * Questions to focus on for discussion:
         1. This is not the first paper Swneson and Enquist published on the structure of this forest. What did their first paper focus on and what did it show? (You don't need to go find this other paper, the basic info is in this one)
         2. They talk about other work that has examined whether functional traits were phylogenetically conserved. WHat did this other work discover?
         3. Swenson and Enquist look at this community in a couple of different ways (I'm not talking about just functional vs phylogenetic clustering , I mean different ways they looked at how these were related), what were these different ways they analyzed the community? Why did they do this?
         4. What did they find about functional trait clustering in this community?
         5. How do they interpret the clustering?
         6. WHat would Kraft et al say about this interpretation?
         7. What does this paper say to you about phylogenetic and functional diversity? (I deliberately left this question very vague - it can be about how they're related, Whether its useful to study this, different ways we should be thinking about diversity, or any other thoughts this paper inspired)
    * Reading: [Spatial mismatch and congruence between taxonomic,phylogenetic and functional diversity](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01493.x)
         * Questions to focus on for discussion:
         1. What question are Devistor et al trying to address?
         2. What data do they use?
         3. How do they justify the functional traits they select?
         4. How are they quantifying diversity?
            - what is the data they are using for alpha, beta, gamma scales?
            - why are they using Rao's Quadratic Entropy (Q)?
         5. What did Devictor et al find?
         6. How do these results compare to Swenson and Enquist? Are they consistent? Yield different insights?
         7. If you are a conservation planner, what do these results mean to you?

* *September 20*: 
    * Discussion: Patterns in Abundance 
         * Reading: [Species abundance distributions: moving beyond single prediction theories to integration within an ecological framework](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01094.x)
            * Questions to focus on for discussion:
               1. What is a species abundance distribution?
               2. What are the different ways a species abundance distribution can be plotted?
               3. What is the species abundance distribution of interest to ecologists?
                  * there is more than one answer to this question- pick the one resonated with you
               4. What processes have people proposed to explain the species abundance distribution
               5. What are some of the ways people judge which model is 'better'?
                  * did one of those seem like a better approach to you? Why?
               6. Why has it been difficult to figure out which model fits the data best?
               7. What to the authors propose is a better way to move forward?
               8. In the species abundance distribution literature, two models pop up a lot: log normal and log series. Be able to explain what is different about them (Being able to draw them is fine).
               9. What is a veil line?
               10. From page 1006 to the end, the paper is full of suggestionsl for things that should/need to be done to help us better understand the species abundance distribution. Which approaches sounded most interesting/promising to you. Why?
         * Reading: [Commonness and rarity in the marine biosphere](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1406664111)
            * Questions to focus on for discussion:
               1. What question is Connolly et al trying to answer?
               2. What is the curse of dimensionality? Why do niche based models suffer from it but neutral ones do not?
               3. In class, I'll explain the gamma vs. log normal approach Connoly took and why, but it is based on  a paper by Pueyo that shows how theoretically a specific type of abundance distribution (a gamma distribution) should emerge from most neutral models. What do Connolly et al do to support their use of the gamma distribution to represent neutral models?
               4. How do real data fit the gamma and log normal distributions. Does one tend to fit better than the other?
               5. There is a table showing the model fits fro the community scale to the regional scale. Did the results vary by scale?
               6. Why is it important to know whether the model that fails does so in a consistent way or idiosyncratic?
               7. The failing model couldn't explain two different types of species. What were those types and do you think a single process would explain why both groups deviate from the failing model? Why or why not?
               8. Does this paper implement any of the improvements in testing models that McGill et al suggested?
               9. Do you think terrestrial systems would show as clean a result as the marine systems do? Why?
    * Class Activity: Alpha, Beta, Gamma

* September 22: Patterns in Body Size
      - Question for discussion
            1. There is a variety of evidence suggesting shrinking body sizes is one of the expected responses to climate change (no I'm not making this up. You can read this if you want to know more but this is not required for class: [Declining body size: a third universal response to warming?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2011.03.005). Think about the two assigned papers. What impacts might declining body sizes have on current body size distributions and food webs?

            2. What did they do to address their question? (what type of data did they compile, what did they do with that data)
            3. What did they find?
            4. Why do their pollinator networks seem to be robust to extinctions?
            5. How do these results differ from the previous food webs results that had been published?
            6. What do they think is causing the difference in response to extinctions between mutualism networks and trophic networks?
         * Readings: [Stability of Ecological Communities and the Architecture of Mutualistic and Trophic Networks](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1188321)
            * Questions for Discussion
            1. Why have differences between mutualism and trophic networks been hard to understand?
            2. How did Thebault and Fontaine approach this question so they could be compared?
            3. Did the networks they designed retain their initial structure or did they change over the simulations? What happened and why?
            4. How did modularity and nestedness impact the stability of the networks?
            5. How did the empirical results compare to what their models suggested they should find?
    * Class Activity: Group Projects
 

* September 29: Productivity-Diversity Debate
      * For class you will break into small groups to figure out what you think is going on with this debate. Is someone right and someone wrong? Is everyone right or everyone wrong? How do we walk away from a debate like this with a better understanding of what is going on in nature? The first two papers set out the main debate. The second two are short comments about technical and conceptual issues. Make sure to have a firm grasp of the first two papers and you can have a looser grasp of the two short comments. At the end of class we will come back together as a group and see how different groups thought about this debate.

            3. How do Elahi et al suggest their results and the results of other studies can be reconiled with studies showing global biodiversity loss?
            4. Do Dornelas et al and Elahi et al have any influence on the biodiversity-ecosystem function research area?
   * Class Activity: Group Projects
 
### Weeks 7-9: Regional-Scale Diversity Patterns & Processes
 
* October 13: Regional Assembly - Dispersal     
   * (yes I am only assigning 1 paper. Enjoy!) Reading: [The metacommunity concept: a framework for multi-scale community ecology](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00608.x)
        * Questions for Discussion
             1. We've spent a lot of the semester focused on community-scale biodiversity patterns and the mechanisms thought to generate them. What scale have we predominately been focusing on?
             2. What mechanisms have we predominately been focused on as generating biodiversity patterns?
             3. What mechanism is this paper arguing we should add to that list?
             4. What is a metacommunity?
             5. Is the study of metacommunities still focused on the "community-scale", a larger scale, or both? Why do you think this?
             6. What is the difference between spatially implicit and explicit models of metacommunities? Was the model of neutral theory that we covered in class implicit or explicit?
             7. The term 'species pool' is used several times in this manuscript. What is the species pool? Where does it come from?
             8. Why is a species pool important? How can changes to it impact observed metacommunity dynamics?
             9. They acknowledge that "local communities do not always have discrete boundaries and that different species may respond to processes at different scales" Do you think a patch based view works for your system? Can be used as a coarse approximation? Completely irrelevant to your system? Why?
            10. Be able to explain (succinctly) the four main types of metacommunity models. What are they and how are they different? (i.e. how do they differ in their assumptions about patches, which species can enter the community, the role of nichebased processes, differences among species, etc).
            11. Which model do you think applies to your system? Why? (yes I will go around the room on this one. Be able to name a relevant model and explain why it applies (in 1-2 sentences). If you do not think a metacommunity framework applies, say that and why. I'd recommend writing your sentence before class so you aren't caught off guard. If I was Stephen Hubbell here's what I would write: I study a tropical tree community that I think fits into the neutral model. I think this because we have dispersal, though its limited, and niche differences between species seem small (or non-existent) and its hard to see how those small differences create stable coexistence.
