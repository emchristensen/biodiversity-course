Tuesdays are often a split between class activity and discussion, thus there are often two topics on those days. Thursdays are always just discussion. Activity days when laptops are required are noted in italics.

            * Note from Morgan: I will provide a cartoon overview of the Neutral Theory in class. In this reading, I want you to focus on the following issues:
               * How does Hubbell's view of communities compare to the Biotic/Environmental filter papers?
                  * Is there an important concept deliberately ignores?

         * Questions to focus on for discussion:
         1. This is not the first paper Swneson and Enquist published on the structure of this forest. What did their first paper focus on and what did it show? (You don't need to go find this other paper, the basic info is in this one)
         2. They talk about other work that has examined whether functional traits were phylogenetically conserved. WHat did this other work discover?
         3. Swenson and Enquist look at this community in a couple of different ways (I'm not talking about just functional vs phylogenetic clustering , I mean different ways they looked at how these were related), what were these different ways they analyzed the community? Why did they do this?
         4. What did they find about functional trait clustering in this community?
         5. How do they interpret the clustering?
         6. WHat would Kraft et al say about this interpretation?
         7. What does this paper say to you about phylogenetic and functional diversity? (I deliberately left this question very vague - it can be about how they're related, Whether its useful to study this, different ways we should be thinking about diversity, or any other thoughts this paper inspired)
    * Reading: [Spatial mismatch and congruence between taxonomic,phylogenetic and functional diversity](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01493.x)
         * Questions to focus on for discussion:
         1. What question are Devistor et al trying to address?
         2. What data do they use?
         3. How do they justify the functional traits they select?
         4. How are they quantifying diversity?
            - what is the data they are using for alpha, beta, gamma scales?
            - why are they using Rao's Quadratic Entropy (Q)?
         5. What did Devictor et al find?
         6. How do these results compare to Swenson and Enquist? Are they consistent? Yield different insights?
         7. If you are a conservation planner, what do these results mean to you?

* *September 20*: 
    * Discussion: Patterns in Abundance 
         * Reading: [Species abundance distributions: moving beyond single prediction theories to integration within an ecological framework](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01094.x)
            * Questions to focus on for discussion:
               1. What is a species abundance distribution?
               2. What are the different ways a species abundance distribution can be plotted?
               3. What is the species abundance distribution of interest to ecologists?
                  * there is more than one answer to this question- pick the one resonated with you
               4. What processes have people proposed to explain the species abundance distribution
               5. What are some of the ways people judge which model is 'better'?
                  * did one of those seem like a better approach to you? Why?
               6. Why has it been difficult to figure out which model fits the data best?
               7. What to the authors propose is a better way to move forward?
               8. In the species abundance distribution literature, two models pop up a lot: log normal and log series. Be able to explain what is different about them (Being able to draw them is fine).
               9. What is a veil line?
               10. From page 1006 to the end, the paper is full of suggestionsl for things that should/need to be done to help us better understand the species abundance distribution. Which approaches sounded most interesting/promising to you. Why?
         * Reading: [Commonness and rarity in the marine biosphere](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1406664111)
            * Questions to focus on for discussion:
               1. What question is Connolly et al trying to answer?
               2. What is the curse of dimensionality? Why do niche based models suffer from it but neutral ones do not?
               3. In class, I'll explain the gamma vs. log normal approach Connoly took and why, but it is based on  a paper by Pueyo that shows how theoretically a specific type of abundance distribution (a gamma distribution) should emerge from most neutral models. What do Connolly et al do to support their use of the gamma distribution to represent neutral models?
               4. How do real data fit the gamma and log normal distributions. Does one tend to fit better than the other?
               5. There is a table showing the model fits fro the community scale to the regional scale. Did the results vary by scale?
               6. Why is it important to know whether the model that fails does so in a consistent way or idiosyncratic?
               7. The failing model couldn't explain two different types of species. What were those types and do you think a single process would explain why both groups deviate from the failing model? Why or why not?
               8. Does this paper implement any of the improvements in testing models that McGill et al suggested?
               9. Do you think terrestrial systems would show as clean a result as the marine systems do? Why?
    * Class Activity: Alpha, Beta, Gamma

* September 22: Patterns in Body Size
      - Question for discussion
            1. There is a variety of evidence suggesting shrinking body sizes is one of the expected responses to climate change (no I'm not making this up. You can read this if you want to know more but this is not required for class: [Declining body size: a third universal response to warming?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2011.03.005). Think about the two assigned papers. What impacts might declining body sizes have on current body size distributions and food webs?
