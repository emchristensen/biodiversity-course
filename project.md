# Class Project Information

## Next Deadline

* 10/7 Finalized Groups
    * Each group needs to email me to let me know who is in your group
* 10/24 Select topic
    * Each group should email me to let me know what your topic is
* 11/29 Group Presentations Begin
    * Can you give a short overview of your topic area - what is it and why is is important to study
      - E.g. If you're interested in trait clustering in communities, then you should be able to explain why the field has been interested in understanding patterns of trait clustering
    * Can you explain clearly what we don't yet understand and why we really need to understand it
      - E.g. what about patterns of trait clustering to we not understand? Why is this gap in our knowledge important? If we can solve this can it help us understand a theory of ecology, design better experiments or conservation policies, or something else?
    * Can you explain why we don't understand this thing yet (what has prevented us from already solving the problem you've identified)
      - E.g. Do we not have enough data? Have we not collected the right type of data to definitively resolve the question? Why do we not have enough data or the right type of data?
    * Can you explain what your plan is for solving this issue and getting us closer to answering the question you've outlined?
      - E.g. this is the part where you get to be creative. Be as practical or impractical as you want. If you think you have a real solution, go for it. If you can figure out how to do it assuming technology that doesn't yet exist or that you could pull off with unrealistic funding levels thats good too. Or do you need to imploy some science fiction technology to be able to do what you want? 
    * If you answer yes to all of those questions, then you are ready to go!


## Task

To work collaboratively on identifying a gap in our knowledge about biodiversity and devise a creative plan for addressing it.

## Learning objectives

* To work collaboratively to identify problems that needs to be solves and devise a plan for solving them
* To apply the knowledge of biodiversity that they are gathering in class
* To gain additional depth on a biodiversity topic
* To practive the use of creativity in science

## Implementation

* A considerable amount of class time will be devoted to the class project. 
* Small groups of 3-4 people will work together on a class project
* The group will need to identify something we don't understand about biodiversity
* The group will need to devise a plan for filling that gap in knowledge
    * plans do not need to be based on what we are capable of doing currently in ecology
    * plans should identify what the ideal data to answer the question would be
    * plans should devise a creative way for obtaining that data
* Groups will present in class their project at the end of the semester
    * Presnetations will need to introduce the audience to the current state of knowledge on their topic
    * Explain clearly what we currently do not understand about that topic
    * Present their idea for how to fill the current gap in knowledge
