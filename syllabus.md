#### **Times and Locations**

Tuesday, Period 5 (11:45-12:35), MCCA 3194

Wednesday, Period 3 (9:35-10:25), MAT 0010

#### **Course Objectives**

The goal of this class is to provide students a basic understanding of biodiversity patterns often studied in the field 
of ecology. By the end of the semester, students will:
1)	Have an appreciation of the complexity of term “biodiversity”
2)	Have a broad understanding of widely studied biodiversity patterns that exist at different spatial and temporal scales
3)	Become familiar with various ecological processes that generate and help maintain biodiversity patterns


#### **General Course Structure and Expectations**

This course is designed to provide advanced training for graduate students in a specialized area of ecology. 
This course is a mixture of lecture, class discussion of primary literature and hands-on experience involving 
some class activities and a major project. While there is some lecturing, class participation, intellectual 
engagement with topics, and discussion participation are the main ways students will learn in this class. 
The first hour of Tuesdays and Thursdays are devoted to lecture and class discussions. You are expected to 
come prepared to discuss the assigned papers. The second hour on Tuesdays are devoted to either class activities 
or working on group projects. This course is designed to provide advanced training for graduate students in a 
specialized area of ecology. 

#### **Course Grading**

60% of grade will be based on a class project and presentation (330 points), 
40% will be based on class participation in discussion* (220 points, 10 points/class day).

*Undergraduates uncomfortable with the expectation of participating in a graduate discussion 
should talk to me about a written alternative.


#### **Attendance Policy**

Two days can be missed without impacts on your grade without the need
to submit make-up work, though we recommend that students attempt any 
missed class activities on their own time because additional class 
activities or discussions may rely on that knowledge. 

Up to 4 additional missed days can be made-up by submitting make-up work.
Class activities can be made-up on the student's time within a week by doing
the activity and submitting the code/data for instructor evaluation. Missed 
discussions can be made up by providing a written summary of the readings 
for the day(s) missed. Written summaries will involve 1-paragraph summary of the 
main questions and findings for each assigned paper and 1 paragraph 1 paragraph synthesizing 
what these papers mean in conjunction about our understanding of biodiversity.

If a student anticpates missing more than 6 class days (i.e. 3 weeks of classes), you
must talk to the instructors beforehand.

#### **Course Materials**

1)	There is not a required or recommended text book for this class
2)	All reading materials will be made available through the Canvas e-learning system. You must have an active GatorLink ID to access e-Learning. Should you encounter problems with your GatorLink account or need assistance, contact GatorLink website (http://gatorlink.ufl.edu ) or UF Computing Help Desk: The Hub, 392-HELP for assistance. If you need assistance with the e-Learning system, please visit e-Learning Support Services home page (https://elearning2.courses.ufl.edu/portal/help/main) or contact e-Learning Support Team (UF Helpdesk HUB 132; Phone:(352) 392-HELP (4357); Email:learning-support@ufl.edu). 
3)	Laptops: On specific days (notes on the course schedule) laptops or tablets will be required to participate in literature search and basic computational activities.


### **UF Policies**

#### **University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities**

Students requesting accommodation for disabilities must first register
with the Dean of Students Office (http://www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/). The Dean
of Students Office will provide documentation to the student who must
then provide this documentation to the instructor when requesting
accommodation. You must submit this documentation prior to submitting
assignments or taking the quizzes or exams. Accommodations are not
retroactive, therefore, students should contact the office as soon as
possible in the term for which they are seeking accommodations.

#### **University Policy on Academic Misconduct**

Academic honesty and integrity are fundamental values of the University
community. Students should be sure that they understand the UF Student
Honor Code at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/students.php.

#### **Netiquette and Communication Courtesy**

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common courtesy
in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats.
