title: Class 6 Questions
---

Today's topic involves the "debate" between niche/determinism theory and stochastic/neutral theory.
* What do we mean by the terms deterministic and stochastic?

#### Questions for Hubbell: Neutral theory in community ecology and the hypothesis of functional equivalence

* What is the main assumption that sets neutral theory apart from classical community assembly? (phrased another 
way, what element of classical community assembly does Hubbell get rid of?)
* What were Hubbell's reasons for developing neutral theory?
* There are a lot of tree species at BCI.  How does Hubbell explain this?  Why don't a few strongly competitive species drive the others extinct?
* Fig. 1 shows the trade-off between shade-tolerance and fast growth in gaps.  Why are there more species at the shade-tolerant end?
* This paper has discussed neutral theory using plants as a model.  Do you think these same ideas will apply equally to animals?


#### Questions for Chase: Drought mediates the importance of stochastic community assembly

* Under what conditions should stochasticity in community assembly be more important?
* What pattern is Chase using to distinguish niche-assembled communities from stochastically-assembled communities?
* Can you think of a way you might replicate Chase's experiment with Hubbell's BCI tree community (if you could magically have 20 replicates of BCI to work with, that is)? What would constitute a "harsh environment?" Think about the trade-off Hubbell is describing in Fig. 1
* Is Chase agreeing or disagreeing with Hubbell?
