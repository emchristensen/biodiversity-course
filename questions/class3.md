#### Questions for Kraft et al. Disentangling the Drivers of Beta Diversity Along Latitudinal and Elevational Gradients
* What is a diversity gradient? Which ones are they studying here?
* What are the two scales that could be driving these diversity gradients?
* what are alpha, beta, and gamma diversity?
* What dimension of biodiversity is beta diversity related to?
* I want you to think a moment about beta diversity. To do so, think about these two scenarios:
* Given the same landscape, would you expect a dispersal limited group to have higher beta diversity or lower beta diversity than a group of species that are good dispersers? Why?
* Given the same landscape, how would you expect beta diversity to be different if that area had a large vs a small species pool?
* How do they operationally measure alpha, beta, and gamma diversity?
* How does alpha, beta, gamma change with latitude and elevation?
* What are the 3 ways that beta diversity can calculated?
* What makes beta diversity complicated to interpret?
* How do they try to deal with this problem with beta diversity?
* What do they conclude?
* Do you agree with this conclusion? Are you convinced?
* Regardless of whether you like or dislike the study, what do you think the next step is?

#### Questions for Jost Partitioning diversity into independent alpha and beta components
* What is the goal of this paper?
* WHat are the 5 basic properties alpha and beta diversities should have?
* What is a numbers equivalent? (if you're having trouble with that section, look at Table 1 and think about what those diversity indices produce and how you would interpret that number).
* In the section "Decomposing a diversity index" what does Jost say is the best way to decompose gamma into alpha and beta?
* In the section alpha and beta, what is the exact interpretation of beta diversity that emerges from Jost's approach?
Once you hit "Case 1", I have no specific questions and will not ask any. The rest of the paper is Jost providing examples and further justification for this approach to diversity indices and decomposition of gamma into alpha and beta. We can talk about any questions or thoughts this inspired. The rest of my questions are about thinking about these two papers in concert.
* What do you think Jost would say about the Kraft et al paper? What do you think Kraft et al would say about Jost?
* Clearly, beta diversity is a complicated beast. Why do we keep trying to quantify it? WHat are we really trying to know?
