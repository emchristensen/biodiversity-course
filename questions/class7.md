#### Questions for Swenson and Enquist Opposing assembly mechanism in a Neotropical Dry Forest
    
* This is not the first paper Swneson and Enquist published on the structure of this forest. What did their first paper focus on and what did it show? (You don't need to go find this other paper, the basic info is in this one)
* They talk about other work that has examined whether functional traits were phylogenetically conserved. WHat did this other work discover?
* Swenson and Enquist look at this community in a couple of different ways (I'm not talking about just functional vs phylogenetic clustering , I mean different ways they looked at how these were related), what were these different ways they analyzed the community? Why did they do this?
* What did they find about functional trait clustering in this community?
* How do they interpret the clustering?
* What would Kraft et al say about this interpretation?
* What does this paper say to you about phylogenetic and functional diversity? (I deliberately left this question very vague - it can be about how they're related, Whether its useful to study this, different ways we should be thinking about diversity, or any other thoughts this paper inspired)

#### Questions for Devictor et al Spatial mismatch and congruence between taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity
* What question are Devictor et al trying to address?
* What data do they use?
* How do they justify the functional traits they select?
* How are they quantifying diversity?
    *  what is the data they are using for alpha, beta, gamma scales?
*  why are they using Rao's Quadratic Entropy (Q)?
* What did Devictor et al find?
* How do these results compare to Swenson and Enquist? Are they consistent? Yield different insights?
* If you are a conservation planner, what do these results mean to you?
