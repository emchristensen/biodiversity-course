Questions for Ricklefs
* In the second paragraph ("Present-day ecological investigations...."), Ricklefs describes what he sees as the state of the field in 1987. Do you think this is still a valid assessment of the field today? Why?
* Ricklefs proposes that local deterministic processes make common predictions: "i) community convergence, ii) resistence of the community to invasion, and iii) independence of local and regional diversity." Explain why these are the expectastions from local processes (i.e. what are the mechanisms/processes that would result in those outcomes?)
* What concept(s) does Ricklefs argue has gotten lost in diversity research?
* What is the key concept that community ecologists use to assume that local biodiversity processes ware separate from regional diversity processes?
* What are Figures 2 & 3? How does Ricklefs interpret them?
* How does Ricklefs propose ecology expand its focus from predominately local processes? 
* Think about the Tilman & Pacala section from the Environmental Heterogeneity reading and Hubbell's neutral theory in the context of Ricklef's paper. i) what does Tilman & Pacala figure 2.1 say to you about increasing regional diversity and local coexistence? ii) Do you think Hubbell's neutral model is something that implements Ricklef's ideas?

Questions for Hulbert and White
* According to White and Hurlbert what has been missing from this debate over local vs. regional control of local richness?
* What is variance partitioning and how do they use it to push forward the local-regional debate?
* What are the local variables they exmaine? What are the regional variables?
* How do local and regional variables relate to local diversity?
* At what time scales do local or regional variables have their strongest signal? Why?
* How do they propose local and regional processes are combining to determine local richness?
