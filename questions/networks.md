#### Questions for Tolerance of pollination networks to species extinctions

* What are Memmott et al trying to understand about pollinator networks?
* What did they do to address their question? (what type of data did they compile, what did they do with that data)
* What did they find?
* Why do their pollinator networks seem to be robust to extinctions?
* How do these results differ from the previous food webs results that had been published?
* What do they think is causing the difference in response to extinctions between mutualism networks and trophic networks?


#### Questions for Stability of Ecological Communities and the Architecture of Mutualistic and Trophic Networks
* Why have differences between mutualism and trophic networks been hard to understand?
* How did Thebault and Fontaine approach this question so they could be compared?
* Did the networks they designed retain their initial structure or did they change over the simulations? What happened and why?
* How did modularity and nestedness impact the stability of the networks?
* How did the empirical results compare to what their models suggested they should find?
