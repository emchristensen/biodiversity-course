* What processes have people proposed to explain the species abundance distribution
* What are some of the ways people judge which model is 'better'?
    * did one of those seem like a better approach to you? Why?
* Why has it been difficult to figure out which model fits the data best?
* What to the authors propose is a better way to move forward?

* What is a veil line?
