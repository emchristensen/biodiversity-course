* What is the Species-Area relationship (describe it conceptually).
* If all species in a region were equally distributed across space (i.e. each sampling unit held all species in the region), what would you expect the relationship between Area and number of species to look like?
* What do you think it means that the species-area relationship doesn't look like that?
* What mathematical form does the Species-Area relationship take? (they allude to is in the introduction, but you can fid it in the methods)
* The intro is basically a hodge podge of all the things people have thought about the species-area relationship over the years. Be able to explain the following:
    * the environmental heterogeneity hypothesis and the demographic process hypothesis
    * community similarity vs. scale-independent
    * how processes driving the species-area relationship are expected to change with scale
* The methods explain how species-area relationships arecalculated from nested vs. independent samples. What is the difference between these two approaches?
* There are tons of results. For our purposes, let's pull a couple out to think about in the context of the processes we have discussed thus far in class:
    * if you have two areas (same taxa, same ecosystem types) but the species-area relationship is steeper in one area than the other, what does that mean?
    * what processes do you think could be driving the increase in slope as the body size of the organisms studied increases?
    * what processes do you think could be driving the decrease in slope as you move away from the equator?
