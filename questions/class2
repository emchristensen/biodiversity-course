### Questions for Naeem et al "The Functions of Biodiversity in an Age of Extinction"

* What are the different dimensions of biodiversity that the authors discuss? Be able to define each of them briefly.
* Do the authors think we should study one dimension at a time, figure out which dimension is most important? Or something else?
* From this manuscript, how does it seem that ecology has been studying these dimensions of biodiversity?
* If you had to guess what an average biodiversity study looked like from their description, what would it look like?
* What is ecological structure?
* Why do they think ecological structure is important?
* Why is it difficult to figure out how important changes in biodiversity are for ecosystem function?
* What issue/challenge for biodiversity research does the term 'External Validation' refer to?
* What current challenges for biodiversity research do they outline?
* Why do they think biodiversity is important to conserve?
* Do you have other reasons why you think biodiversity is important?
