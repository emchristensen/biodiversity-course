title: Metacommunity Questions

*   MacArthur & MacArthur:
        how are they defining environmental heterogeneity? What is it and what scale (‘Microsite’, within habitat, across habitats?
*   Tilman & Pacala:
        how are they defining environmental heterogeneity? How does it compare to how MacArthur & MacArthur are thinking about it?
        how does environmental heterogeneity promote higher diversity in their model?
*   Shmida & Wilson
        how do they definte environmental heterogeneity. Compare it to the previous papers.
        Compare how environmental heterogeneity promotes diversity in this exerpt in comparison to the exerpts from the other two papers. What is similar and what is different?
        What other concepts in ecology does it make you think of?
*   Stein et al
        In table 1, look at all the different ways scientists have tried to quantify environmental heterogeneity. Think about how Shmida and Wilson talk about environmental heterogeneity and what is being quantified in Table 1. What do you think about how environmental heterogeneity is being quantified. What does it tell us about the complexity of the environment?
        What was the general outcome of the meta-analysis?
        What does this say to you about the relationship between environmental heterogeneity and species richness?
*   Fahrig
        One of the things landscape ecology studies is role of the configuration of the landscape. What is in the perspective of the landscape that is missing from the ways environmental heterogeneity is being quantified in the studies Stein et al compiled?
        Why might this aspect of environmental heterogeneity be important?
*   Allouche et al.
        How are area and heterogeneity related?
        Why is the niche width of a species important for understanding how biodiversity responds to increasingly complex environments?
        Brainstorm reasons this relationship may not have been seen in Stein et al. These can be statistical or biological reasons having to do with either paper. I know I haven’t given you enough info to know for sure what might be an issue and what they may have corrected for or examined in secondary analyses, I just want you to think generally about the issue.
