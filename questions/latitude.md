title: Latitudinal Gradient
---

* What is the gap in knowledge about latitudinal gradients that this paper is trying to fill?
* What are the four main hypotheses for explaining the latitudinal gradient in diversity?
* What are the four critical assummptions that all their simulations contain?
* Describe what happens during a simulations for the 4 different simulation scenarios (i.e. I'll stand at the board and you will tell me what to draw for each simulation)
* What metrics did they measure from the simulation outcomes?
* How simliar were the results from the simulations? How did they differ?
* They end with their simulations. But what do you think the next step is?
* What do you think about the approach they use to study something that we cannot experiment with? 
    * How do you feel about their argument for testing multiple predictions?
    * How often do you think we do this in biodiversity research?
