title: Latitudinal Gradient
---

* On the processes generating latitudinal richness gradients: identifying diagnostic patterns and predictions
    * What is the gap in knowledge about latitudinal gradients that this paper is trying to fill?
    * What are the four main hypotheses for explaining the latitudinal gradient in diversity?
    * What are the four critical assummptions that all their simulations contain?
    * Describe what happens during a simulations for the 4 different simulation scenarios (i.e. I'll stand at the board and you will tell me what to draw for each simulation)
    * What metrics did they measure from the simulation outcomes?
    * How simliar were the results from the simulations? How did they differ?
    * They end with their simulations. But what do you think the next step is?
    * What do you think about the approach they use to study something that we cannot experiment with? 
        * How do you feel about their argument for testing multiple predictions?
        * How often do you think we do this in biodiversity research?
    
* Functional trait space and the latitudinal diversity gradient
    * Why do they think focusing on functional traits rather than species richness is a more powerful approach when looking at diversity across gradients?
    * What is a hypervolume a measure of?
    * WHat are the three groups of theories being assessed in this paper? 
    * Do they match with the ones Hurlbert and Stegen explore?
        * Are there simlarities? 
        * What are the major differences in in how these two groups are thinking about these mechanisms?
    * Be able to walk me through the different predictions at the alpha, beta, and gamma scales.
    * WHat do you think their results tell you about patterns of diversity at continental-global scales?
