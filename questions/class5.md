#### Questions for Wieher and Keddy: Assembly Rules, Null Models, and Trait Dispersion: New Questions from Old Patterns

A lot of the 1st page deals with an old debate that they are trying to move past. For the purposes of our discussion, this debate isn't 
important, though I am happy to talk about it if there is time in class. 
* What I do want you to pull out of the first section is: What is an assembly rule?
* What are the patterns in trait dispersion that a community could exhibit?
* Which pattern do they relate to biotic filtering and which to environmental filtering? 
    * Why?
* Why do they think taxonomic approaches to studying communities are problematic?

#### Questions for Kraft et al: Community assembly, coexistence and the environmental filtering metaphor

* The first two pages of the paper give you an overview of how the Wieher and Keddy concept has evolved. 
What has turned out to be tricky about the environmental filter concept? 
* Do Kraft et al think that trait similarities can be ascribed to filtering in the environment?
* They use coexistence theory to explain their perspective on this. 
    * What are stabilizing mechanisms and how might we expect those mechanisms to drive trait patterns?
    * What are equalizing mechanisms and how we might expect those mechanisms to drive trait patterns?
* How do they propose to redinfe environmental filtering?
* What are your thoughts on their perspective on environmental filters?
* What do you think the paper means for how we can use patterns of trait variation in ecology?
