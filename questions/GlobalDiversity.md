title: Global Diversity
---

* Understanding global patterns of mammalian functional and phylogenetic diversity
    * Why are patterns of phylogenetic diversity important to understand?
    * Why are patterns of functional diversity important to understand?
    * Figure 1 shows possible relationships between FD and PD. 
    * Explain what the phylogenetic constraint space represents 
    * Why might functional diversity be higher than expected given the amount of phylogenetic diversity? (WHat does that even mean?)
    * Why might functional diversity be less than expected from phylogenetic diversity?
    * Conceptually, species richness constrain PD and FD. How?
    * What were the observed patterns between species richness, PD, and FD?
    * Did continents differ in their observed phylogenetic/functional diversity relationship? What do you think this means?
    * What were the differences in patterns between the temperate and tropical regions? What did they suggest explained that difference?
    * The paper talks a lot of about communities, but does the data used here represent communities? What might this better reflect? Does that change how you think about the results?
