Damschen et al

1. Describe the fragmentation experiment - what are the different fragments, what habitats are the fragments and matrix?
2. How does wind interact with these fragments differently than it does with the matrix?
	a. Does it interact with the different fragment types differently? How?
I think this paper is really cool and fun, but I think it's importance is really as a catalyst for thinking about how environmental heterogeneity and dispersal interact. So, to start you down that path, I want you to think about the following questions:
1. What is dispersal limitation? This term floats around and is common in metacommunity literature. But what is it? Think about the term dispersal limitation in the context of the Damchen paper. How is it operating?
2. NOw I want you to think about our discussion about dispersal and metacommunities and our arrows and patches. How might our view of the probability of dispersal among patches change with the info in Damschen?
3. Can you think of other systems/taxa that might operate like the Damchen system? WHere the physical aspects of the environment will change dispersal/colonization probabilities?

 
Rivera-Ortiz et al

1. What things should influence whether habitat fragmentation influences genetic diversity?
2. What is publication bias?
3. We haven't talked about genetic diversity in detail before, so be able to explain the various metrics being used: He, A, F_IS, 
4. What is the general response of genetic diversity to fragmentation?
5. Let's think back to the Damschen et al paper. 
	A. What habitat is considered the 'fragment'.
	B. What habitat is being fragmented?
	C. Given what we learned in the Damschen paper about dispersal, How might genetic variation response differently given which habitat you are focusing on?
	D. Do you think it's random chance that the species in open fragments tend to be wind dispersed? Why? How might that change how species respond to fragmentation?
