title: Hotspots
---

* Global hotspots of species richness are not congruent with endemism or threat
    * What is an endemic species?
    * What do we mean by a 'hotspot'?
    * How congruent were the different types of hotspots?
    * What type of places were most of the species richness hotspots?
    * What type of places were most of the endemism hotspots?
    * What type of places were most of the threat hotspots?
    * What do the authors suggest might be behind the differences in the patterns of species richness vs endemic richness?
* The Influence of Late Quaternary Climate-Change Velocity on Species Endemism
    * What is climate-change velocity?
        * Would a 1 degree change in temperature have the same climate-change velocity everywhere?
    * What impact should high climate-change veolcities have on species - particularly on species with different dispersal abilities?
    * How do global patterns of endemism relate to global patterns of climate-change velocity?
    * Think back to the patterns in the first paper - given this paper, would you expect species richness hotspots and endemism hotspots to be in the same locations?
