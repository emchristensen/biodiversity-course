title: Hotspots
---

* Global hotspots of species richness are not congruent with endemism or threat
    * What is an endemic species?
    * What do we mean by a 'hotspot'?
    * How congruent were the different types of hotspots?
    * What type of places were most of the species richness hotspots?
    * What type of places were most of the endemism hotspots?
    * What type of places were most of the threat hotspots?
    * What do the authors suggest might be behind the differences in the patterns of species richness vs endemic richness?
* A global assessment of endemism and species richness across island and mainland regions
    * Explain the Endemism Richness index. How is it calculated and what is it telling you?
    * How did the endemic richness index differ between islands and mainlands?
    * How did patterns in the endemic richness index compare across the different taxa assessed?
    * Compare these results to the other assigned paper. What do they tell you in combination about patterns of endemism?
